            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Developed for Carrier  as an outreach effort, this project serves as a hub of information available to those interested in FIRST robotics and related events. It will enhance connections between members of the community, enabling them to become sponsors or mentors, and to join teams for participating in competitions. The project is meant to highlight the year’s challenge (“game”), teams, sponsors, archived information, and volunteer opportunities for users, and will also include an admin page that will simplify updates to the previously mentioned pages. The website will draw from APIs provided by FIRST robotics and/or The Blue Alliance to populate the frontend with retrieved information. This project is focused on developing a highly maintainable, modular design that will simplify expansions in scalability as more FIRST robotics teams, competitions, and community projects are added from the Upstate Region and eventually beyond.</p>
